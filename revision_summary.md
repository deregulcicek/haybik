# Revision Summary: Addressing Reviewer Feedback

## Overview of Major Revisions

This document summarizes the comprehensive revisions made to address feedback from all three reviewers. The revisions focus on strengthening the theoretical framework, improving methodology transparency, enhancing empirical rigor, and clarifying conceptual contributions.

## Reviewer 1 Feedback - Addressed Revisions

### 1. Theoretical Framework Improvements

**Original Issue**: SSA concept overlapped with established notions like filter bubbles and echo chambers without clear distinction.

**Revision**: Added Section 2.1 "Conceptual Distinctions: SSA vs. Established Constructs" that explicitly differentiates:
- Filter Bubbles: Algorithmic filtering without user awareness
- Echo Chambers: Self-reinforcing ideological environments  
- SSA: Broader phenomenon encompassing affective, structural, and discursive dimensions

### 2. Research Questions Clarification

**Original Issue**: Four research questions listed without specifying whether they are exploratory or accompanied by hypotheses.

**Revision**: 
- Clearly stated this is an "exploratory study" in Section 1.2
- Reformulated research objectives to emphasize exploratory nature
- Added explicit statement about generating insights rather than testing hypotheses

### 3. Methodology Transparency

**Original Issue**: Insufficient detail about sample selection, saturation, and demographics.

**Revision**: Added comprehensive methodology section (4.2) including:
- Sample size justification (theoretical saturation reached)
- Detailed demographics (age range, gender, platforms, political orientation)
- Recruitment period and selection criteria
- Interview duration and ethical considerations

### 4. Sentiment Analysis Robustness

**Original Issue**: Testing on only five sentences provides unreliable performance estimates.

**Revision**: 
- Replaced toy test with 5-fold cross-validation
- Added proper performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Acknowledged moderate performance (ROC-AUC: 0.67) rather than claiming "high success"
- Added corpus size (15,000 comments) and scraping details

### 5. Causal Language Adjustment

**Original Issue**: Claims that algorithms "create" SSA use causal language that doesn't match cross-sectional evidence.

**Revision**: Changed language to "may contribute to" and "potential consequence" throughout the manuscript to reflect the exploratory, non-causal nature of the study.

### 6. Ethics and Data Sharing

**Original Issue**: Ethics statement unclear about IRB approval and consent procedures.

**Revision**: Added specific details about IRB approval, consent procedures, and data availability statement in Appendix C.

## Reviewer 2 Feedback - Addressed Revisions

### 1. Theoretical Framework Enhancement

**Original Issue**: Missing integration of Dean's communicative capitalism concept.

**Revision**: Added Section 2.2 "Communicative Capitalism and Algorithmic Exploitation" that examines how algorithmic systems transform communicative practices into exploitable commodities.

### 2. Algorithmic Resistance Integration

**Original Issue**: Missing perspective on user agency and resistance.

**Revision**: Added Section 2.3 "Algorithmic Resistance and User Agency" incorporating Bonini & Treré's (2025) work on algorithmic resistance.

### 3. Echo Chamber Literature Update

**Original Issue**: Need for Bruns' work on echo chamber factionalism.

**Revision**: Integrated Bruns (2017) in Section 3.2 to provide critical examination of echo chamber effects and polarization.

### 4. Individual-to-Community Leap Problem

**Original Issue**: Logical leap from individual experiences to community spillovers lacks empirical support.

**Revision**: 
- Removed unsupported claims about community-level effects
- Added Kossowska et al. (2023) reference to acknowledge complexity
- Focused analysis on individual experiences and perceptions

### 5. Research Questions Restructuring

**Original Issue**: Questions too broad and compound multiple inquiries.

**Revision**: Reformulated into four focused exploratory objectives that can be meaningfully addressed within the study scope.

### 6. Interview Protocol Transparency

**Original Issue**: Need for detailed explanation of interview structure and bias mitigation.

**Revision**: 
- Added detailed interview protocol in Section 4.2
- Explained bias mitigation strategies
- Moved detailed questions to Appendix A

### 7. Results Discussion Enhancement

**Original Issue**: Results lack organic discussion informed by critical algorithm studies literature.

**Revision**: Enhanced Section 6.1 with theoretical contributions and better integration of literature throughout the results discussion.

## Reviewer 3 Feedback - Addressed Revisions

### 1. Literature Review Nuance

**Original Issue**: Literature review often repetitive and unidirectional, presenting filter bubbles/echo chambers as necessarily negative.

**Revision**: 
- Added Section 3.1 with Möller et al. (2020) showing algorithms can increase diversity
- Integrated Loecherbach et al. (2020) unified framework for media diversity
- Acknowledged complexity and contested nature of algorithmic effects

### 2. Source Currency

**Original Issue**: Citing outdated sources (Pariser 2011, Terranova 2000) without acknowledging changed digital context.

**Revision**: 
- Added Seaver (2019) for "traps" metaphor
- Updated literature with recent empirical studies
- Acknowledged evolution of digital landscape since early works

### 3. Conceptual Clarity

**Original Issue**: Important terms remain vague (e.g., "diverse content," "alternative viewpoints").

**Revision**: 
- Added operational definitions throughout
- Clarified conceptual framework in Section 2
- Acknowledged complexity of operationalizing diversity

### 4. SSA Concept Development

**Original Issue**: SSA insufficiently developed and lacks clear definitions.

**Revision**: 
- Added comprehensive definition in Section 2.1
- Integrated with Marxian alienation theory in Section 2.4
- Provided clear theoretical grounding

### 5. Methodological Limitations

**Original Issue**: Small sample sizes severely undermine robustness and credibility.

**Revision**: 
- Acknowledged limitations in Section 6.2
- Added detailed limitations discussion
- Provided justification for sample size decisions
- Added future research directions for larger studies

### 6. Qualitative-Quantitative Integration

**Original Issue**: Striking discrepancy between qualitative findings (users feel "trapped") and quantitative results (neutral sentiment).

**Revision**: Added Section 5.3 "Integration of Qualitative and Quantitative Findings" that addresses this tension and suggests SSA may be context-dependent rather than universal.

### 7. Policy Recommendations

**Original Issue**: Policy recommendations underdeveloped and lack substantial discussion.

**Revision**: 
- Expanded Section 6.3 with specific policy implications
- Added regulatory literature engagement
- Provided concrete intervention strategies

## Conclusion

The revised manuscript addresses all major concerns raised by the reviewers while maintaining the core contribution of the SSA concept. The revisions strengthen the theoretical framework, improve methodological transparency, enhance empirical rigor, and provide a more nuanced understanding of algorithmic mediation effects. The study now presents a more balanced and academically rigorous examination of the relationship between algorithmic content curation and social experience.
