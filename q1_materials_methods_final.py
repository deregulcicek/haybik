The diagram demonstrates how Algorithmic Manipulation operates through content control mechanisms, Digital Alienation manifests through psychological disconnection patterns, Platform Dependency emerges through behavioral reliance structures, and Echo Chamber Effects propagate through belief reinforcement systems. Each type is positioned relative to the central digital platform node, showing both direct and mediated pathways of influence. The visual representation reveals that these categories are not mutually exclusive but rather overlapping phenomena that can co-occur and amplify each other. This framework provides researchers with a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing SSA patterns in digital communication, offering both theoretical clarity and practical application for content analysis.')

The performance hierarchy shows SVM outperforming Gradient Boosting (86.7% accuracy), while Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieve identical performance at 83.3% accuracy. This pattern suggests that kernel-based approaches effectively handle the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in SSA linguistic patterns. The SVM\'s success likely stems from its ability to find optimal hyperplanes in the high-dimensional feature space created by the dual-vectorizer approach. The relatively narrow performance gap between algorithms (6.7 percentage points) indicates that the feature engineering strategy successfully captures meaningful SSA indicators, though the choice of algorithm still significantly impacts classification quality. These results validate the theoretical framework by demonstrating that machine learning can effectively distinguish between different types of digital alienation expressions.')

The ROC analysis shows exceptional performance for positive SSA expressions (AUC = 0.994), indicating that users employ highly distinctive linguistic patterns when expressing positive forms of digital alienation, such as enthusiastic platform engagement or algorithmic appreciation. Neutral expressions achieve moderate performance (AUC = 0.933), reflecting the inherent ambiguity and mixed signals present in balanced or conflicted digital communication. Negative SSA expressions show the lowest but still respectable performance (AUC = 0.919), suggesting that negative alienation patterns may be more subtle or context-dependent. This performance gradient aligns with theoretical expectations about how users express different types of digital alienation, where positive expressions often involve explicit platform-related terminology, while negative expressions may rely more heavily on contextual cues and implicit indicators.')

The feature importance analysis highlights terms such as "algorithmic," "control," "connected," and "world" as key indicators of SSA patterns, demonstrating how users conceptualize their relationship with digital platforms through specific linguistic markers. The prominence of "algorithmic" and "control" terms reflects the theoretical framework\'s emphasis on Algorithmic Manipulation and Platform Dependency, while "connected" and "world" suggest the complex interplay between digital connectivity and social alienation. The feature importance scores reveal that users employ both explicit platform-related terminology and more abstract conceptual language when expressing digital alienation. This finding validates the theoretical framework by showing that SSA manifests through identifiable linguistic patterns that can be systematically analyzed and classified. The feature importance analysis also provides practical insights for content moderation and digital well-being interventions by identifying the specific language markers associated with different types of digital alienation.')
