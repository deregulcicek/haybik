        'This study investigates how algorithm-driven content curation impacts mediated discourse, '
        'amplifies ideological echo chambers and alters linguistic structures in online communication. '
        'While these platforms promise connectivity, their engagement-driven mechanisms reinforce biases '
        'and fragment discourse spaces, leading to Synthetic Social Alienation (SSA). By combining '
        'discourse analysis with in-depth interviews, this study examines the algorithmic mediation of '
        'language and meaning in digital spaces, revealing how algorithms commodify attention and shape '
        'conversational patterns. This study also categorizes participant comments as positive, negative, '
        'and neutral using sentiment analysis and examines the emotional tone of these comments. '
        'Our hybrid approach combining original interview data with synthetic SSA-focused data achieved '
        'excellent performance with Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 87.1%, ROC-AUC: 0.983) and Random Forest '
        '(Accuracy: 84.3%, ROC-AUC: 0.984). Cross-validation scores of 0.940 (±0.065) and 0.942 (±0.052) '
        'respectively indicate robust model training and generalization capability. The findings highlight '
        'the need for regulatory interventions and ethical algorithm design to mitigate discourse '
        'polarization and restore critical engagement in digital public spheres.'
